public class Client {

//    adapter - for incompatible interfaces
//    converts an interface of a class into another interface that clients expect
//    adapter does the conversion between interfaces
//    also known as a wrapper - wraps incompatible interfaces into one
//    decoupling client from knowing specific interface
//    two implementation - composition and generalization(inheritance)

//    SW EXAMPLES:
//    we have existing software system, we want to add new capability
//    to it from different vendor, new vendor has different interface
//we dont want to change our existing code, we will adapt new interface with ours

//    adapter acts as middle man from client and converts request into ones
//    that can be responded by new vendors interface, not only ours old one

//    jdk - java.util.Arrays as list()
//    java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream) - returns reader
//    java.io.OutputStreamWriter-returns a writer

//    two classes don't know how to talk to each other
